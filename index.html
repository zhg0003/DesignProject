                <h1>What is a Lucid Dream Generator</h1>
                <h2>About Lucid Dreaming</h2>
                <p>A lucid dream is a dream during which the dreamer is aware of dreaming. During lucid dreaming, the dreamer may be able to exert some degree of control over the dream characters, narrative, and environment <br>
                
                Paul Tholey laid the epistemological basis for the research of lucid dreams, proposing seven different conditions of clarity that a dream must fulfill in order to be defined as a lucid dream: <br>
                
                1) Awareness of the dream state (orientation)<br>
                2) Awareness of the capacity to make decisions<br>
                3) Awareness of memory functions<br>
                4) Awareness of self<br>
                5) Awareness of the dream environment<br>
                6) Awareness of the meaning of the dream<br>
                7) Awareness of concentration and focus (the subjective clarity of that state).<br><br>

                Later, in 1992, a study by Deirdre Barrett examined whether lucid dreams contained four "corollaries" of lucidity:<br>

                1) The dreamer is aware that they are dreaming<br>
                2) Objects disappear after waking<br>
                3) Physical laws need not apply in the dream<br>
                4) The dreamer has a clear memory of the waking world<br>

                Barrett found less than a quarter of lucidity accounts exhibited all four.

                Subsequently, Stephen LaBerge studied the prevalence of being able to control the dream scenario among lucid dreams, and found that while dream control and dream awareness are correlated, neither requires the other. LaBerge found dreams that exhibit one clearly without the capacity for the other; also, in some dreams where the dreamer is lucid and aware they could exercise control, they choose simply to observe.</p>
                <h2>Goals of Lucid Dream Generator</h2>
                <p>The Goals of a lucid dream generator is to stimulate the user in order to make lucid dreams easier to achieve, whether if it's by conditioning of the user, or by inducing the listener in a state suitable for lucid dreaming by frequency generation.
                <br> An additional goal of Lucid Dream Generator is to collect data in order for further scienticific research could be done in the field, and to provide data to discovery which techniques could be used to easier achieve lucid dreaming.</p> <br>
